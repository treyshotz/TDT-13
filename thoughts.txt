Random thoughts or observations which can be mentioned and discussed in the report

Category distribution:
- Traffic is clearly the most frequent one
- Arrangement, skadeverk, sjÃ¸, dyr have very few incidents compared to traffic
- Noticeable imbalance in the categories -> challenging when we start modelling
- Could we implement any techniques to help with the imbalance, like over/under-sampling? Should read papers on
how much preprocessing before doing BERT etc.

Hourly distribution
- Surprising how many messages at nights, it happens less at night, so it makes sense that it is fewer messages at night
- Peak: 12-14
- Off-peak: 1-6

Text length dist:
- Bimodal, observe two peaks
- Most texts are centered around 100-150 char, and the other peak around 11-150

Text stats
- Avg length is 146 char
- Shortest is only 1 character hmm
- Longest is 280
